# CS-330-SNHU
I have a multitude of skills that I have added to my tool belt. Being able to implement and explain realistic lighting is the skill that I am most excited to utilize in the future. I followed a slow implementation design process. I would work on a singular aspect of my project until it was fully complete before ever moving onto the next step. I believe that each project has its own way it should be completed, but there are a ton of projects that would utilize what I have described. I struggled throughout many steps of the project. One thing that really helped me was talking out loud to my significant other to help process what was going on. The project went through many iterations. The starting iteration was frankly awful. But slowly working on it unveiled an impressive scene. Frankly, I restarted the project more than once. Luckily, after I knew what I was doing. I was able to save a ton of time implementing it the way I should have from the beginning. I have never even touched graphics before. This class has given me an immeasurable amount of ability. In the future, I hope to develop my own ideas utilizing 3D graphics in OpenGL
